=== IMPORTANT: BACKUP YOUR FILES FIRST ===

Before replacing files, please backup the original versions:

1. Via cPanel File Manager:
   - Navigate to each file location
   - Right-click → Copy
   - Create a "backup" folder
   - Paste the files there

2. Via FTP:
   - Download the original files to your computer
   - Keep them in a safe location

ORIGINAL FILES TO BACKUP:
- app/Controllers/AdminController.php
- routes/web.php
- app/Views/admin/settings.php
- app/Views/trading/trade.php

This way, if anything goes wrong, you can quickly restore the originals.
