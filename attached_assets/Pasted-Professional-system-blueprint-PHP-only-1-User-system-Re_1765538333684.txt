The best Replit AI Agent prompt (COPY + PASTE)

Use this exactly:

Build a professional trading platform using ONLY PHP 8.2 (no Node.js, no Python, no Laravel required). Use MySQL/MariaDB. Use an MVC structure with clean routing. Create 2 panels: (1) User dashboard (2) Admin dashboard.

Core features:

Authentication: register/login/logout/forgot password, password hashing, secure sessions, login logs.

Wallet system (manual approvals): deposits are sent to admin wallet, user submits amount + txid + proof image, admin approves/rejects, user balance updates. Withdrawals: user requests amount + wallet address, admin approves/rejects, status paid/pending, admin marks paid manually. Prevent duplicate txid.

Trading: markets for Forex & Crypto. Support market orders + limit orders + stop loss + take profit + leverage + margin. Store orders, positions, trades, and calculate PnL. Include liquidation when margin is insufficient.

Prices: integrate a public price API (example: CoinGecko for crypto + a forex rates API). Save latest prices to DB every minute (cron). Use DB prices for charting and order triggers.

Order triggers: cron job checks limit orders, stop loss, take profit. When triggered, execute trade, update position and wallet margin.

Admin panel: manage users, suspend/activate, approve deposits/withdrawals, set leverage limits per market, set spreads/fees, manage referral rules (reward only after referred deposit reaches minimum).

Security: CSRF protection, input validation, prepared statements, server-side authorization middleware, audit_logs table logging every admin action and financial change.

UI: simple clean dashboard (Bootstrap allowed). Do not add complex JS frameworks.
